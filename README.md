# my-confessions
My Confessions is a safe place for honest stories that people rarely speak about. They are stories of childhood wounds, love, betrayal, regret, healing, and survival. They  are shared anonymously - not for judgement, but for understanding. Some stories may touch deeply. Some may remind you of your journey. Some may help you heal quietly.
