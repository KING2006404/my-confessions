“There’s a memory I’ve carried for years… and it still hurts like it happened yesterday.” 
I grew up in a home where silence was louder than shouting. We never talked about feelings. We never said “I’m sorry.”
We just… survived each day.
I remember one night, I must have been around nine. I had a terrible nightmare and ran to my mother’s room for comfort. 
Instead of hugging me, she looked irritated… as if my fear was an inconvenience.
She said, “Go back to bed. Stop making things up.” That moment broke something in me.

For the first time, I realized that the person meant to protect me… didn’t know how to love me in the way I needed.
As I walked back to my room, crying quietly, I promised myself I’d never depend on anyone again.
And maybe that’s why, even as an adult,
I struggle to let people in.

REFLECTION 
It’s crazy how childhood wounds follow us everywhere. How one moment of rejection can shape
the way we love, the way we trust, and the way we see ourselves.

I’m finally learning that healing isn’t about forgetting. It’s about giving yourself the love you never received.

If you’ve ever carried a childhood wound…
just know you’re not alone. And it wasn’t your fault.
